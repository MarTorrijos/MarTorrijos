### A Bit About Me

Before diving into tech, I worked in video marketing, where I got the chance to lead projects both solo and with teams.

Some of the things I did:

- Creating videos from concept to final cut
- Mentoring junior video artists, helping them level up their skills
- Working with cross-functional teams to deliver content on time and to a high standard

While my background isnâ€™t in coding, Iâ€™ve learned that these skills are valuable in any professional setting.

When I'm not coding you can find me rock climbing, baking bread or making ethically questionable decisions in RimWorld.
